Feature: User Login
  In order to allow users to login
  As a guest to the site
  I want to be able to login to a previously created account

#  Scenario: User can login into their own account
#  	Given there is a user with the name "Anis", an email "azarei@gettyimages.com", and a password "password1234"
#    When viewing the login page
#    And I fill out the "username" field with "Anis"
#    And I fill out the "password" field with "password1234"
#   And I click the login button
#    Then I can see "Welcome Anis!"

#  Scenario: User login failure with invalid user
#    When viewing the login page
#    And I fill out the "username" field with "Anis"
#    And I fill out the "password" field with "password1234"
#    And I click the login button
#    Then I cannot see "Welcome Anis!"

#  Scenario: User login failure with invalid password
#	Given there is a user with the name "Anis", an email "azarei@gettyimages.com", and a password "password1234"
#    When viewing the login page
#    And I fill out the "username" field with "Anis"
#    And I fill out the "password" field with "password7890"
#    And I click the login button
#    Then I cannot see "Welcome Anis!"
